# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-ANN
The Neural Network model would be able predict the severity of heart disease in patient with the given set of attributes. 
The main goal is to parallelize the training phase using OpenMP to reduce the training period.
We will mailnly be working with heart disease dataset of Cleveland.
